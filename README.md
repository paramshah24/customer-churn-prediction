# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains resources and code for predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

- **churn.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and model-building process for customer churn prediction.
- **WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv**: The dataset used for training and evaluating the model. It contains customer data from a telecom company.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the repository.
- **.gitattributes**: Configuration file for Git attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset, `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`, includes various features such as customer demographics, account information, and service usage details. It is used to predict whether a customer is likely to churn.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `churn.ipynb` to explore the analysis and model-building process.

## Goals

- Understand the factors contributing to customer churn.
- Build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.
